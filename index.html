            He was offered the role of Xander in Joss Whedon's series <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>

            comedy <i>The In-Laws</i> and starred with Wesley Snipes in the action movie <i>Blade:Trinity</i>,
            for which he trained for three months and gained 25 pounds.

            <i>R.I.P.D.</i>, <i>Self/less</i>, and <i>Deadpool</i>. The latter film, about the Marvel Comics
            antihero, was a blockbuster hit, and Reynolds subsequently starred in and cowrrote the sequel,
